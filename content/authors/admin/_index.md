I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of New South Wales, Australia. I am currently employed on the Australian Research Council Discovery Project 'Reconstructing Australia’s fire history from cave stalagmites.'

Originally from Far North Queensland, I completed my BA at The University of Queensland, and then my PhD at the University of Western Australia, where I researched the  [Palaeoclimate of the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/speleothem-based-palaeo-climate-research-methodology-applications). After my PhD I worked for Queensland Department of Environment and Science, before taking up a Postdoctoral position at [University College Dublin](https://palaeoclimate.com.au/), where I worked in conjunction with the Queensland State Government and water utility companies to develop a database of Australasian palaeoclimate records and reconstruct 1000 years of rainfall for southeast Queensland. In June 2021 I joined the University of New South Wales, where I am working with researchers at UNSW and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation to reconstruct fire histories in Western Australia.
